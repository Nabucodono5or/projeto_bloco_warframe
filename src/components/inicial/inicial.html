      <p>
        Primary weapons are mainly separated into Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper
        Rifles and Bows, as these are the four categories that have unique mods
        to them, as well as Sortie missions limited to each type.

      <span>Secondary Weapon</span>
      <p>
        Secondary weapons come in many forms, mostly pistols, though also
        throwing knives, shotguns and launchers. They all use the same mods and
        Pistol ammo, however.

      <span>Melee Weapon</span>
      <p>
        Melee weapons do not use ammo. They all use the same mods, though
        there's a variety of melee types, each with their unique Stances.

      <span>Mods</span>
      <p>
        Mods are essentially the upgrade system in WARFRAME in the form of
        special cards that can be equipped to Warframes, weapons, Companions,
        K-Drives and Archwings to enhance damage, power, survivability, speed,
        precepts, and utility.

      <span>Warframes</span>
      <p>
        The true nature of the Warframes and their Tenno connection is a secret
        lost to the Old War. Together, they represent our best hope in turning
        the tide of the machine war.

  <p>
    Warframe is a free-to-play action role playing third-person shooter
    multiplayer online game developed and published by Digital Extremes. In
    Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors
    who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep far into Earth's future to find
    themselves at war in the planetary system with different factions. The Tenno
    use their powered Warframes along with a variety of weapons and abilities to
    complete missions. While many of the game's missions use
    procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world
    areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games as well as some
    story-specific missions with fixed level design. The game includes elements
    of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to
    advance their Tenno with improved gear. The game includes both player versus
    environment and player versus player elements. It is supported by
    microtransactions, which lets players purchase in-game items using real
    money, but also offers the option to earn them at no cost through grinding.
